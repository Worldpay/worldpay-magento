How To use
================
Login to your Magento Admin Panel.
Go to System -> Configuration.
On the left menu scroll down to the sales section, and click Worldpay Payments.

Add your keys, which you can find in your Worldpay dashboard (Settings -> API keys). Change Enabled to Yes, set your title and payment descriptions to what you would like the user to see.

In your Worldpay dashboard, (Settings -> Webhooks) add a webhook to your Magento URL.
For example;
http://www.mywebsite.com/index.php/worldpay/notification/

Changing www.mywebsite.com to your website URL. Visiting this URL should show OK is similar. Your URL most be externally accessible.

For testing, sometimes your local server isn't setup correctly to validate SSL certificates. To disable SSL checks in test mode, set 'Disable SSL check in test mode' to Yes.

If you change your API keys in future, you may need to clear the Magento cache for it to take affect immediately.
